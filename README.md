Remote control Youtube video using a Hapi server
================================================

I was sick and didn't want to get up to pause the Youtube video from the Great War channel,
so I made a web service to pause and resume the video.

This works really well with React Native App that I made.

Also: I've never programmed AppleScript before so any suggestions are welcome.

env.json
--------

```json
{
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 8000
}
```
